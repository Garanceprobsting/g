    <p>My name is Garance Pröbsting and I'm a French-German product designer specializing in furniture for hospitality and residential environments. Rooted in a background that spans both furniture and interior design, my practice focuses on the dialogue between objects, space, and people. I work with durable materials not only for their environmental responsibility but for their capacity to form a genuine relationship with the people who live alongside them. My aim is to create objects that become companions in our lives,  mediators of our daily rituals and active presences quietly shaping the way we inhabit and experience our spaces.</p>
